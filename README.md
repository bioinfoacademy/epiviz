Epiviz
======

Epiviz is a scientific information visualization tool for genetic and epigenetic data, used to aid in the exploration and understanding of correlations between various genome features.

Using with Docker
-------------------

This repository includes a `Dockerfile` to run a webserver that serves
the epiviz web application. It includes a `site-settings.js` file that
sets up data backends pointing to the University of Maryland. Update
that file to use a different backend.
